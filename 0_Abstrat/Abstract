Abstract: Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen. The previous system used to activate the wiper manually and the process of pulling up the wiper is difficult to be handled. Thus, this system is proposed to solve these problems. The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing automatic wiping system, to improve the system by using sensor with actuator and to design a basic program that will fully operate with the system.The Red LED is ON, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs Wiper is OFF: On press of the user input, Blue, Green and Orange LEDs come ON one at a time with the set frequency, The frequency changes on every alternate key press, 3 frequency levels with 1, 4 and 8 Hz Wiper is ON: The LED glow pattern stops on the 4th press; the wiper action starts next press onwards as mentioned in step 2 The Red LED is OFF, if the user button is pressed and held for 2 secs.
