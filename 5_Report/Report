The automated rain wiper system is used to detect rainfall and activate wiper automatically without driver interaction. This system fulfills the safety of the drivers to focus on their primary task of driving.At present, engineers are investigating fully automated systems that vary the speed of the wiper blades according to the rate of the rainfall and the speed of the vehicle. These systems are used in luxury cars, SUVs, and other expensive automobiles. So, that the aim is to develop an automated wiper system which varies the speed of the wiper blades with the rate of the rainfall for non-expensive automobiles which ordinary customers can buy.It complicate things because the driver has to concentrate simultaneously on driving and wiper. With drivers exposed to increased distraction, automatic rain sensing wiper system becomes more appealing feature, as they eliminate the risk and distraction to turn on the wiper manually. In this automatic wiper system, a rain sensor, microcontroller and a driver integrated circuit is used to convert manual operation into automatic operation. When water falls on the rain sensor, the sensor sends the signal to the microcontroller and then the microcontroller processes the data and energizes the driver IC to turn on the wiper. With these modifications automatic cleaning of the glass can be done without the involvement of the driver.
